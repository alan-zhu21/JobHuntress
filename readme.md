Current schema for this project: <img src='/Current_Schema.JPG'>

Users can register, log in, and search for jobs across different job boards (currently only Linkedin and Monster). Returned jobs can be saved to the user profile and/or removed. Each job has a simple title, location, and company name. Clicking it takes the user to the actual job posting for a longer description.
